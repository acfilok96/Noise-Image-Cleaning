In this Project, we remove noise from Image data using deep Learning model.

Noise in images can be a quite a problem. It often occurs when you record an image (e.g. take a photo) without having enough light available. We can think of noise as adding random numbers (positive and negative) to each pixel value. So, in a noisy image some pixel values will be brighter than they should be and some will be darker.

Denoising is the process of trying to remove the noise from a noisy image to restore the original image. Many algorithms have been developed to achieve this. However, they all have their limitations and a denoised image will never be as good as the original. A denoised image will always lose some of its details.
